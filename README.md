# Weather-Bot
Weather Bot was born out of a final project for an Introduction to Programming with Python class. The program provides current weather metrics for a specified location and helps you interpret them with recommendations.

Summary:
Weather is one of the most primal and universal concerns in humanity. It has the power to influence every personâ€™s daily decisions. As a result, it is incredibly important for people to have an accurate, up-to-date weather forecast for them to make well-informed decisions about their plans. 

To expedite this decision process, we created Weather Bot. Weather Bot is an interactive application that displays the weather forecast based on user input of city and state. Using the collected weather information, the program makes relevant recommendations. 

The objective of this application is to assist everyday individuals in interpreting the weather. Users will no longer have to predict whether they should bring an umbrella or dress a particular way because our application decides for you. By using Weather Bot, users can automate this part of their day, which leaves more time and attention to focus on other important matters. To ensure customer satisfaction, the program will provide accurate and instantaneous information for any location.
